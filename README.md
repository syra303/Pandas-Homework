### Determine whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P 500) and the whales portfolios.
---
Harold's Algo 1 strategy has a sharpe ratio of 1.38 which is more than double that of the S&P 500's sharpe ratio of 0.65. While both standard deviations (amount of risk) are similar at 1.27 and 1.29 respectively, we can conclude that investing in Harold's Algo 1 strategy would reap a higher reward per given amount of risk compared to investing in the S&P 500. This conclusions can also be supported by comparing Algo 1's cumulative return and the market's cumulative return as Algo 1 had a cumulative return of 1.93 between the dates of 03-03-2015 and 04-23-2019 where as the market had a cumulative return of 1.37 between the same time period. 

Algo 2 on the other hand did not return a sharpe ratio larger than that of the S&P 500, nor did the cumulative returns outperform that of the market within the periods of 03-03-2015 and 04-23-2019.

Comparing Harold's strategies with the whales portfolios, a similar conclusion can be made about Harold's Algo 1 strategy. Algo 1's sharpe ratio was significantly higher than that of the whales portfolios and Algo 1's cumulative returns also outperformed that of the whales portfolios. 

The data also shows that Harold's Algo 2 strategy has a higher sharpe ratio and cumulative return than Tiger Global Management, Paulson & Co, and Soros Fund Management where Tiger Global and Paulson & Co returned a negative sharpe ratio as well as a cumulative return below 1.0. This tells us that an investment allocated to either Tiger Global or Paulson & Co on 03-03-2015 would result in a negative return by 04-23-2019. 

Algo 2 however did not outperform Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio as Berkshire's Sharpe ratio and cumulative return were both higher than that of Algo 2's. 

### How does your portfolio do?

Between 2018-05 and 2019-08 we can see that my portfolio would reap a higher reward given the amount of risk given that it's sharpe ratio is higher then the market's and all other portfolis with the execption of Harold's Algo 1 portfolio. It is also worth noting that my portfolio appears to be most closely correlated to the S&P 500 based on the heatmap, which is not surprising since the total market cap of AAPL, GOOG, and COST combined makes up about 17% of the S&P 500's $33 trillion total market cap.
